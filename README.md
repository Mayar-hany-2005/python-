# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features such as area, location, number of rooms, etc.

## 📌 Overview

- **Goal**: Build a regression model to accurately predict housing prices.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Used**: Linear Regression

## 🧠 Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building & Evaluation
5. Visualization of Predictions vs. Actual Prices

## 📊 Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

## 📈 Results

- Achieved high accuracy with a simple linear regression model.
- Visual comparison between predicted vs. actual prices showed promising results.
